# HyperionDev Capstone Project 5


This project builds upon everything you have learned so far with relational databases and file formats. We will be working on a mock relational database based on Hyperion Dev. This is not the actual design of our system but rather an oversimplified mock design. From our mock design, we have determined the following rules: a student can take one or more courses, a course is taken by one or more students, a course is taught by a single teacher, a set of reviews of the content is given to each student in a course, and the address of each student and teacher is stored on the database.
